# Test ideas
#
# REVERSABLE LEVEL/VOLUME calculation
# Pond level/volume function needs to be reversable. The level calculated from a volume
# must always equal the volume calculated from a level; assuming capacities aren't
# exceeded.
#
# Volume and level values must never be negative.
#
# Allocation must never result in a negative volume/level.
#
# Weather effects must never result in a negative volume/level.
#
# Exceeding capacity must report an overflow.
#
# Exceeding capacity must always result in level or volume that is equal to the
# capacity.
#
# Correct calcuations when performing calcs with no ponds, 1 pond, >1 pond.
